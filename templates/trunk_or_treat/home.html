    <li>*Trunk: How people from America say 'Car boot'. See also 'hood', 'trash can' and 'biscuit'. Seriously, when they say biscuit, they don't mean what you think they mean. Don't even get me started on 'jelly'. That said, if it weren't for them, we wouldn't have cultural icons like George Washington and Napoleon Dynamite, so we'll let it slide. You still reading? Even with this font? It's nice to feel like someone's interested in what I have to say. Did you know that people waste more time online than they do walking? That's not true. I made that up. But I bet you thought it was true. After all, you're clearly still going with this. I bet you're the type of person who watches the credits all the way through too, aren't you? Not judging I do that too. Have you noticed that films don't do that as much any more? That's because it's not cool. I'm not saying you're not cool. Well, you might not be. To be fair, you could be anyone. You need to go away now because I don't talk to strangers. Go on. Go. Get lost. Quit following me. It's not difficult, just close the browser. Seriously? Ok. I'm going to go now. Really, I am. Seriously. It's like one of those telephone conversations. You hang up. No you. I didn't realise we'd come that far. This is all so sudden. I don't even know your name. Anyway, I'm not interested. Sorry. Goodbye.</li>
